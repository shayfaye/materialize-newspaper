				<h3>What To Buy From Victoria Beckham For Target, According To Celebs</h3>
					<p>The wait for a Target collaboration to actually drop can be excruciating: We get the designer reveal and then have to wait months for a peek at the result of the pair-up — and then another few weeks for a full lookbook, and then another handful until we can actually shop. We may be used to it at this point, but it doesn’t get any easier year after year, especially when the end-game is wallet-friendly Victoria Beckham dresses. But as we gear up for the Sunday morning debut (which assures that we’ll actually get to brunch on time), we must finalize the game plan for what we’ll actually be gunning for at Target stores and online. Sure, the models very convincingly sold the gingham sets and drop-waist skirts to us in the campaign — but what will Victoria Beckham for Target actually look like IRL? Well, look no further than some of the celebrities that have already gotten their hands on some of the much-anticipated looks.</p>
					<p>Once we got over the requisite envy for having had the opportunity to pre-shop the collaboration, we acknowledged that the chosen few of Hollywood who have been spotted wearing Victoria Beckham for Target actually offer some welcome guidance for picking out and styling pieces from the collection. Camilla Belle may have preferred to wear the matching blouse-and-trouser combo as intended, for instance, but Naomie Harris used the minimalist romper as a building block for a business-super-casual outfit; Jessica Alba, meanwhile, offered the most easily-consumable of #OOTD inspiration by tucking in a bee-printed button-down into pair of high-waisted jeans.</p>
					<p>Allow yourself to get even more hyped up for Victoria Beckham for Target before it drops on April 9. We’re sure Zoe Saldana wouldn’t mind if you copied her outfit, anyway.</p>

				<h3>The Makeup Looks You'll Be Wearing This Spring -- According To Pat McGrath</h3>
				<p>Pat McGrath is one of the greatest artists of our generation — who just so happens to prefer lipsticks and eyeshadows over oil paints and clay. From the gilded lids of Prada to the glitter lips at DKNY, her makeup artistry has become the benchmark by which the rest of the industry measures itself.</p>

				<p>With a career spanning three decades, McGrath has mostly worked behind the scenes, keying the biggest runway shows and editorials in the game, and serving as the creative director for major makeup brands. But in 2015, when she went solo to launch her own namesake makeup line Pat McGrath Labs, it was her turn to bask in the spotlight.</p>

				<p>"The reactions to these launches were so incredible," McGrath says. "My website could barely handle the amount of traffic... and [they] completely sold out both online and in Sephora stores." And, once a product is gone, it's gone; all of McGrath's releases are limited-edition to maintain the quality.</p>

				<p>That's why her latest "launch" is so exciting. McGrath is re-releasing two of her best-selling products next month. "Due to the high demand and popularity of both Skin Fetish 003 and Lust 004, I had to bring them back," she says. Skin Fetish, a highlighting set, will be available on McGrath's site on March 3, while Lust, a glitter lip kit, will hit the web on March 13.</p>

				<p>To celebrate, McGrath dreamed up three spring makeup looks on three of her muses, exclusively for Refinery29. Ahead, she previews the trends we'll all be wearing this season, the backstage techniques to get you there, and her glorious beauty ethos. It just might inspire you to pick up an eyeliner (or whatever your medium of choice) and create something unforgettable, too.</p>

				<h3>Cherry Blossoms Are EVERYWHERE In Japan Now</h3>
				<p>There's no bad time to visit Japan: The foliage in Kyoto around fall is mesmerizing, and Hokkaido in the winter is a snowy wonderland. But, if we were to pick the most magical period in which to experience the country, it would have to be cherry blossom season.</p>
				<p>Every year, from late March to early April, these lovely pink flowers — known as sakura in Japanese — crop up all over the country, prompting everyone to stop everything and head outdoors to take in their full glory.</p>
				<p>Hanami, or flower appreciation, is a tricky sport for tourists, since the forecast for peak periods is notoriously inaccurate. With a beetle epidemic causing a dwindling population of these precious blooms, there's no time like the present to engage in some hanami.</p>
				<p>Since flying to Japan on a whim isn't a possibility for most of us, we're bringing you the next best thing: a virtual escape of gorgeous photos — featuring full blooms from different regions of Japan — so you can marvel at the pretty sights through your computer screen. Still, you'll want to add Japan in cherry blossom season to your travel bucket list, at least for someday.</p>
